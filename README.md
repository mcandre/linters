# Linter Community Wiki

Welcome!

# What is a linter?

Originally, `lint` was a tool for scanning C code for potentially risky lines of code.

The C compiler already includes some checks for risky code, such as scanning to making sure that function signatures match. And unit testing adds dynamic checks to verify the behavior of a running program. Beyond these checks, `lint` adds even more checks, that neither the compiler nor the tests scan.

By *statically* analyzing the code itself before compilation, programmers could maintain a higher level of code discipline, increasing the reliability of the code in multiple compilers and environments.

As time went on, static code analysis was nearly eclipsed in attention, by dynamic analysis: [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_test), that examine how code behaves for different inputs and corner cases. But the linting practice has restored, and spread to more languages--C++ and beyond.

Today, linters are used to supplement unit tests, serving primarily as low priority style checkers. Linters are being written for many programming languages and document formats, detailed below.

[Wikipedia:List of tools for static analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_for_static_code_analysis)

This document often interprets the term "linter" in a wide sense, to include resources for SAST, SCA, memory management validators, code formatters, and style guides.

# Linters

Many compilers include an option like `-Wall` to turn on warnings, `-Wextra` for even more warnings, and also `-Werror` to treat warnings as errors, preventing dirty code from compiling.

## Go

The standard `go` command offers `go fmt` and `go vet` for styling and checking package integrity.

The standard [govulncheck](https://go.dev/blog/govulncheck) utility scans for vulnerabilities among dependencies and among programming language versions. Note that the tool hides vulnerable packages by default, focusing narrowly only on vulnerabilities triggerable by application code, unless the option `-scan package` is provided.

[deadcode](https://go.dev/blog/deadcode) identifies code snippets that appear to be unused, generally recommended for removal.

Note that deadcode has an implicit assumption that at least one `main` application package is present, or at least one unit test is present and the `-test` flag is supplied to deadcode. This may not always interact well with Go projects that act as simple convenience wrappers around CLI tools.

[errcheck](https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck) identifies unchecked errors. In particular, the `-blank` flag (disabled by default) identifies errors assigned to `_`.

[goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports) supplements `go fmt` by organizing imports.

[javac](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) offers a `-Xlint` option to print additional warnings. The [maven-compiler-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/compile-mojo.html) can be configured to automatically pass `-Xlint` to the underlying Java compiler every time a project is built.

In Java 8, javac will feature an `-Xdoclint` option to identify undocumented code.

[JSHint](http://jshint.com/) is far and away the best modern linter available. It's simultaneously easy to use, and highly customizable; offering global and directory specific `.jshintrc` files for rule configuration; and global and directory specific `.jshintignore` files for ignoring certain files and directories, trimming down `jshint`'s output to exactly what you want to see.

[JSLint](http://jslint.com/) helps coders match the code style described in [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/).

[JSLint Errors](http://linterrors.com/js) explains warnings you may see from JSHint or JSLint.

make offers a `-n` dry run option, though sometimes commands are still printed. Use `make -n 1>/dev/null` to suppress this output. Of course, this represents UNIX sh syntax, so redirect stdout to the null device in Windows syntax with `1>NUL` when in Windows.

GNU make offers an additional `--warn-undefined-variables` flag to check for... undefined variables.

## sh / shell / bash

Many shells offer a `-n` option for validating syntax, e.g. `bash -n`, `zsh -n`, `ksh -n`, ...

Note that `sh -n` on many systems actually expands to `bash -n`, `ksh -n`, etc. as `/bin/sh` is usually symlinked to superset shells. Observers keen to guarantee that their portable sh scripts are pure POSIX and not bash scripts, can either run `sh -n` on a system with a bare bones `/bin/sh`, such as Alpine Linux, Busybox, etc., either on bare metal or Docker.

[beltaloada](https://github.com/mcandre/beltaloada) is a convention for writing build systems in pure (POSIX) sh, that enables deeper linting of shell code compared to make and other non-shell build systems.

[Shellcheck](http://www.shellcheck.net/) is a bash linter written in Haskell.

[checkbashisms.rb](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/en/man1/checkbashisms.1.html) is an unmaintained sh linter that reports bashisms. Because it is unmaintained, it features an inverted ROC curve.

[bashate](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bashate/) is a pep8-like linter for bash scripts. Note that bashate is a Python tool, which means you would also want to run Python SCA tools on all environments that install bashate.

A [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) server can generate HTML linter reports for each new code commit.

[Guard](http://guardgem.org/) + [guard-shell](https://github.com/guard/guard-shell) can monitor local code files, automatically outputting linter warnings as the programmer edits his code, simulating a local continuous integration server.

A [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) task can bundle several linters together (e.g. `csslint`, HTML `tidy`, `jshint`), to lint different kinds of files all at once.

[git hooks](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) can be added to a git repo, preventing a programmer from submitting his work until it passes a configured suite of linters.
